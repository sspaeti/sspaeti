### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer with 20+ years of experience. I enjoy maintaining awareness of new innovative, and emerging open-source technologies on [sspaeti.com](https://sspaeti.com) and [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/blog-authors/simon-spati).

I use an extensive [Personal Knowledge Management Workflow](https://www.sspaeti.com/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/)  to capture, organize and share my knowledge. I recently created my [Public Second Brain](https://brain.sspaeti.com). Try and let me know what you think.

I am passioned with many things, here a few: [Data Engineering](https://sspaeti.com), [Writing](https://brain.sspaeti.com/writing), [Productivity](https://www.sspaeti.com/categories/productivity/) and a [Deep Life](https://brain.sspaeti.com/deep-life).
