### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon, a dad and a family person who [pivoted](https://youtu.be/dNASkBuhPy0) into Technical Writing after 20 years in Data Engineering. My passion for this field is shown on my blog, [ssp.sh](https://www.ssp.sh/), where I share open-source data engineering articles, aiming to enrich our community with genuine insights.

My writing journey extends to platforms like Towards Data Science, freeCodeCamp, and Hackernoon. Since 2020, I've been a writer in data engineering on Quora, and recently, I was honored as a top 25 Influencer and content creator on Databand.

At the core of my work is the Â«[Data Engineering Vault](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/data-engineering/)Â», a continuously curated hub of data engineering knowledge designed for interactive and explorative learning. It features over 1000+ interconnected terms, each an opportunity for deeper understanding, enabling you to explore topics in a more connected, unlike traditional approaches.

I'm currently crafting a unfinished book (monthly updated) on [Data Engineering Design Patterns (DEDP)](https://www.dedp.online/), freely accessible on dedp.online. Here, I regularly publish new chapters, eagerly incorporating your feedback to make it a collaborative knowledge of DE patterns.

My creative engine is comes from a sophisticated [PKM workflow](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/pkm-workflow-for-a-deeper-life/), which aids in generating, organizing, and sharing ideas and content. I leverage tools like [Obsidian](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/obsidian-note-taking-workflow/) and Neovim, specifically [vim-motions](https://www.ssp.sh/blog/why-using-neovim-data-engineer-and-writer-2023/), for efficient and idea-rich writing. I share much of this, including topics on data engineering, open-source, writing, and more, on my public [Second Brain](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/).

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you.

#### Sponsor
I like writing about open-source data engineering and teaching what I have learned through my 20+ years. I hope to do this full-time one day. You can sponsor my work [here](https://github.com/sponsors/sspaeti) or [sponsor a chapter](https://dedp.online/appendix/sponsors.html) on my book.
